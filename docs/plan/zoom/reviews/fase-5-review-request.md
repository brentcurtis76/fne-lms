## Chunk Z2-1 — durable managed intent + provision-at-approve enqueue

### Branch and commits

- **Branch:** `feat/zoom-sess`
- **Base:** `e796646` (`origin/main` at the time the worktree was created; the two
  commits since the prompt's stated anchor `513c75c` are docs-only, so every `file:line`
  anchor in the dispatch prompt still resolved)
- **Worktree:** `/Users/brentcurtis/Documents/fne-zoom-sess` (created from the PM
  checkout, per the standing rule that Zoom sessions run no mutating git command in
  `fne-lms-working`)
- **PR:** not opened — the PR opens at phase end, after all Z2 chunks land.

| SHA | Cluster |
|---|---|
| `f7a3df5` | A1 — additive migration + pgTAP column shape + type |
| `5ada5ff` | A2 — close the `is_zoom_managed` eligibility seam |
| `1162c9e` | A3, A11 — the gate module + the feature flag entry |
| `67379a1` | A4–A7 — both approve routes wired |
| `839dc36` | A8–A10 — create-time intent + PUT guard |

### Scope IN (copied from the dispatch prompt §2)

- **S1** additive migration `20260804120000_zoom_managed_intent.sql` adding
  `public.consultor_sessions.is_zoom_managed boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`.
- **S2** close the eligibility seam in `lib/zoom/jobs/meeting-provision.ts` (row type,
  `readSession` select, `SessionEligibilityCheck` union, the branch, the comment).
- **S3** one gate module `lib/zoom/provisioning-intent.ts` that *delegates* to
  `checkSessionEligibility` — master flag, school allowlist, dedupe key, never-throwing
  enqueue.
- **S4** wire `approve.ts` and `bulk-approve.ts`; approval never fails because of Zoom.
- **S5** create-time intent in `POST /api/sessions` (validation, forced provider, NULL
  link, recurrence inheritance).
- **S6** the PUT guard in `pages/api/sessions/[id]/index.ts` (409 on managed link /
  provider edits; admin-only, pre-approval-only intent toggle).

### Scope OUT (copied from §3) — none of this was built or touched

Join API, `meeting-join-policy`, `/meet/session/[id]`, any page or React component,
`JoinMeetingButton`, the workspace Sesiones tab, the "Generar reunión Zoom" scheduler
control (**no UI at all**); `meeting_sync` / `meeting_delete`, reschedule sync, the
atomic reschedule RPC, cancellation and series-cancel, the modality-flip delete;
notifications, reminders, iCal, dual-zone display, dial-in numbers; the Z2 hours-consumer
audit; `community_meetings.is_zoom_managed` (Z6 adds the mirror — PM ruling); any change
to `zoom_internal` schema, grants, RLS or the job RPCs; any refactor of
`meeting-provision.ts` beyond the S2 edits.

### Files, grouped by risk

**Highest — the security/business invariants**

| File | +/- | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pages/api/sessions/[id]/index.ts` | +63/-0 | The PUT guard: managed sessions reject non-null `meeting_link` writes and provider moves off `'zoom'` (409); the intent flag is admin-only and frozen after approval. |
| `lib/zoom/provisioning-intent.ts` | +147/-0 | The only place that decides whether a session is provisioned for, and under which dedupe key. |
| `lib/zoom/jobs/meeting-provision.ts` | +17/-9 | Fifth eligibility check + the column in `readSession`'s select. A wrong select string here is a silent `undefined` that would refuse every session. |
| `supabase/migrations/20260804120000_zoom_managed_intent.sql` | +23/-0 | The column. Additive only; no RLS change, no grant, no destructive statement. |

**Medium — route behaviour**

| File | +/- | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pages/api/sessions/index.ts` | +27/-2 | Accepts the flag; exempts managed requests from the `meeting_link` 400; forces provider `'zoom'` and NULL link; inherited by every recurrence row. |
| `pages/api/sessions/[id]/approve.ts` | +12/-1 | Hoists `approved_at` and enqueues after the status update. |
| `pages/api/sessions/bulk-approve.ts` | +9/-0 | Same, once per updated session. |

**Low — types, flags, schema assertions**

| File | +/- | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/featureFlags.ts` | +6/-1 | `FeatureFlags.ZOOM_MEETINGS` + the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` client `switch` case. |
| `lib/types/consultor-sessions.types.ts` | +11/-0 | `is_zoom_managed` on `ConsultorSession`; optional on `ConsultorSessionInsert` (the DB default covers omission). |
| `supabase/tests/011-zoom-public-rls.sql` | +24/-1 | Column-shape assertions, plan 15 → 18. |

**Tests (new unless noted)**

| File | +/- | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `__tests__/lib/zoom/provisioning-intent.test.ts` | +321 | A3 — gate matrix, allowlist parsing, key rules, never-throws (33 tests) |
| `__tests__/api/sessions/session-approve-zoom-provision.test.ts` | +293 | A4 A5 A6 (11 tests) |
| `__tests__/api/sessions/session-bulk-approve-zoom-provision.test.ts` | +249 | A7, mixed batch (6 tests) |
| `__tests__/api/sessions/session-managed-intent-create.test.ts` | +216 | A8 (9 tests) |
| `__tests__/api/sessions/session-managed-link-guard.test.ts` | +271 | A9 A10 (13 tests) |
| `__tests__/lib/zoom/jobs/meeting-provision.test.ts` | +13/-0 (modified) | A2 — fixture marked managed, two new refusal rows |

### Test evidence

```
npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

- type-check: clean
- lint: clean (`--max-warnings=0`)
- vitest: **Test Files 264 passed (264) · Tests 4298 passed (4298)**
- build: `✓ Compiled successfully`, full page manifest emitted

```
npm run test:db
```

- **Files=8, Tests=338 · Result: PASS** (011 now 18 subtests)

**Fixture change in the existing provision suite.** Exactly one fixture was touched:
`SESSION` in `meeting-provision.test.ts`, which gained `is_zoom_managed: true`. It is the
single happy-path row the whole file provisions for, and only a session the scheduler
marked as managed is ever provisioned for — so it is legitimately managed. Every refusal
case in that file derives from it by patch, which is why no other fixture needed
changing.

**Fail-on-old proof.** `pages/api/sessions/[id]/approve.ts` and
`pages/api/sessions/[id]/index.ts` were stashed (tests untouched) and the two files
re-run:

```
 ❯ session-approve-zoom-provision.test.ts  (11 tests | 3 failed)
     → expected "spy" to be called 1 times, but got 0 times   [A4]
 ❯ session-managed-link-guard.test.ts      (13 tests | 9 failed)
     → expected 200 to be 409   [A9 meeting_link]
     → expected 200 to be 409   [A9 meeting_provider]
     → expected 400 to be 403   [A10 consultant]
 Test Files  2 failed (2)
      Tests  12 failed | 12 passed (24)
```

`npm run test:db` also produced its own fail-on-old evidence before the migration was
applied locally: `Failed tests: 16-18 — Column public.consultor_sessions.is_zoom_managed
does not exist`.

### Where an independent reviewer should push hardest

1. **The dedupe key includes `approved_at` — is that the right trade?** It makes a
   dead-lettered job retryable by re-approving, at the cost that two *concurrent* approve
   requests that both pass the status check would mint two different keys and therefore
   two jobs. The handler is idempotent by checkpoint-adopt, so the second converges, but
   the reasoning is worth checking rather than taking on trust. The key format was
   specified by the plan; the concurrency consequence is mine to flag.
2. **The PUT intent toggle rejects on PRESENCE, not on change.** After approval, any PUT
   carrying `is_zoom_managed` at all is a 409 — including one that re-sends the value the
   row already has. I chose the strict reading ("the field cannot appear after
   approval"); the looser one ("only a genuine flip is rejected") is defensible too and no
   test distinguishes them today. If a later chunk's UI round-trips the whole session
   object, this becomes a real 409.
3. **The gate delegates, but nothing structurally prevents a future inline copy.** The
   proof that `checkProvisionGate` calls `checkSessionEligibility` rather than restating
   it is a spy in the unit test, not a type or a lint rule. Check that the delegation
   assertion is actually load-bearing and not satisfiable by a re-implementation.
4. **`readSession`'s select string.** The column was added to a hand-written column list.
   If it were misspelled, `is_zoom_managed` would arrive `undefined`, the gate would refuse
   *every* session, and no unit test would catch it — the provision suite feeds rows
   directly to the handler and never exercises the real store's select. `test:db` proves
   the column exists but not that this string reads it.
5. **The allowlist "malformed narrows" rule.** `ZOOM_SCHOOL_ALLOWLIST=colegio-77` yields
   an EMPTY set, which refuses every school rather than allowing every school. That is the
   safe direction for a wave rollout but it is a silent, total shutoff — an operator typo
   stops all provisioning with no signal beyond the per-session skip. Worth ruling on
   whether that should log louder.

### Known limitations and deferred items

- **No UI.** The API accepts `is_zoom_managed`; nothing sets it yet. The "Generar reunión
  Zoom" control is explicitly a later chunk.
- **`community_meetings.is_zoom_managed` is not added.** Per the PM ruling in the dispatch
  prompt, Z6 adds the mirror.
- **PUT does not re-validate modality when an admin turns the flag on.** An admin can set
  `is_zoom_managed: true` on a `borrador` *presencial* session. Nothing is provisioned —
  the eligibility gate refuses it at approve time on `modality` — so the flag is inert
  rather than unsafe, but the POST path validates this and the PUT path does not. Not in
  the chunk's S6 spec; flagged rather than silently added.
- **The eligibility check order is visible in the refusal reason.** A session that fails
  both `meeting_provider` and `is_zoom_managed` reports only the former. Intentional (the
  handler stores one `detail`), but triage sees the first failure, not all of them.
- **The `.env.local` needed for `npm run build`** is not in the repo (gitignored); it was
  copied from an existing checkout to run the build gate. Without it the build fails at
  "Collecting page data" on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — an environment artifact, not a
  code failure.
- **Local `test:db` ran against `supabase migration up`, not a full `db reset`.** The
  local Postgres was exactly one migration behind (`20260803170000`), and other
  workstreams share that container, so applying the single pending migration was preferred
  over destroying their local data. CI's `supabase db start` replays every migration from
  scratch and is the real proof that the file composes.
- **Production schema is NOT updated.** Applying the migration to production is a separate,
  Brent-authorized, Brent-executed step. This chunk's green gates prove code correctness
  and nothing about deployment.
